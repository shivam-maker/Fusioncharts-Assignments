# Fusioncharts-Assignments
This project demonstrates a web-based dashboard that integrates FusionCharts to display data from an Excel file. It includes a modern, responsive login/signup page inspired by a sleek design, enabling users to securely log in and access the dashboard. Once logged in, users can view and edit dynamic data visualizations from the Excel dataset.
